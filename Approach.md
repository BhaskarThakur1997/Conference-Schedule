The approach for finding the maximum number of presentations that one person can attend without any overlap involves sorting the presentations based on their end times and then selecting presentations that do not conflict with each other.

Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the approach:

1. Create a List of Tuples:
   - Combine the start times and end times into tuples to represent each presentation.
   - In Java, this involves creating a list of arrays, where each array contains a pair of start and end times.

2. Sort Presentations:
   - Sort the list of tuples based on the end times of the presentations.
   - This ensures that presentations with earlier end times come first in the sorted list.

3. Iterate through Sorted Presentations:
   - Initialize variables for tracking the maximum number of attended presentations (`maxAttended`) and the end time of the last attended presentation (`endTime`).
   - Iterate through the sorted list of presentations.
   - For each presentation, check if its start time is greater than or equal to the `endTime`. If true, it means the presentation can be attended without overlapping with previous ones.
   - If the condition is met, increment the `maxAttended` count and update the `endTime` to the end time of the current presentation.

4. Return the Result:
   - The final result is the maximum number of presentations that can be attended without any overlap.
